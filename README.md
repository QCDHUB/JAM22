## Abstract

We present the first simultaneous global QCD analysis of spin-dependent parton distribution functions alongside their spin-averaged counterparts and pion, kaon, and unidentified hadron fragmentation functions. This analysis includes all data relevant for constraining the polarized light quark sea asymmetry 
Δu¯-Δd¯, in particular the latest polarized W-lepton production data from the STAR Collaboration at RHIC and semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering data from COMPASS, allowing the most robust extraction available with minimal theoretical assumptions. We also extract a self-consistent set of antiquark polarization ratios Δu¯/u¯ and Δd¯/d¯ and determine the signs of the truncated contributions to the proton spin from the light antiquarks.
